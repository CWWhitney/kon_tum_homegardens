Here we model an intervention to address malnutrition among ethnic minority groups in Kon Tum, Vietnam. The model follows observations and discussions and some follow up work by partners of the NIFAM (Nutrition Intervention Forecasting and Monitoring) project in 2022 and 2023. A test run of the intervention will be carried out by the Social Policy Ecology research Institute (SPERI) in Kon Tum with smallholder farmers of the Ca Dong ethnic minority group.

# Kon Tum garden and cooking class simulation

We use the `mcSimulation` function to perform a Monte Carlo simulations to estimate model outputs based on provided parameters and a model function. The Monte Carlo simulation generates a set of estimated model outputs based on random input samples, providing a distribution of potential outcomes.


```{r mcsimulation}
# Source our model
source("KonTum_Garden_Model.R")

# Ensure consistent results with the random number generator
# not for each 'run' of the MC simulation but for 
# consistency each time we call on the simulation 
set.seed(1234) 

garden_simulation_results <- mcSimulation(
  estimate = estimate_read_csv("inputs_kontum_garden.csv"),
  model_function = kontum_garden_function,
  numberOfModelRuns = 1000, #run 1000 times
  functionSyntax = "plainNames"
)
```

The way we present NPV values can influence decision makers. The same information presented in different ways can even lead to different decisions. Here we derive a plot that compares the decision options as pure NPV values.

```{r}
source("functions/plot_distributions.R")
plot_distributions(mcSimulation_object = garden_simulation_results, 
                                    vars = c("NPV_garden", "NPV_no_garden"),
                                    method = 'hist_simple_overlay', 
                                    base_size = 7, 
                                    x_axis_name = "Comparative NPV outcomes")
```

## Framing the outcomes

Under Prospect Theory the way we present NPV values can influence decision makers - the same information presented in different ways can lead to different decisions. For example, framing a projected NPV gain as a "reduction in potential loss" might make it more attractive to decision makers due to loss aversion.

Here we plot the distribution for the decision and frame the projected NPV gain for the 'decision' (distributions for the two options with the NPV values of the `no garden` option subtracted from those for the `garden`). If we display this as a "Reduction in potential loss" it might be more attractive to decision makers due to loss aversion, i.e. the party might put more emphasis on avoiding potential losses than on seeking gains. We can frame our results as a strategy that minimizes losses rather than one that maximizes gains.

```{r framing_NPV_results}
plot_distributions(mcSimulation_object = garden_simulation_results, 
                                    vars = "decision",
                                    method = 'hist_simple_overlay', 
                                    base_size = 7,  
                                    x_axis_name = "Reduction in potential loss")

```

## Summary of results for the decision

## Summary

Use gt_plt_summary() from {gtExtras}

```{r gtExtras_summary}
library(gtExtras)
library(svglite)
# Subset the outputs from the mcSimulation function (y) to summarize only on the variables that we want.
mcSimulation_summary <- data.frame(garden_simulation_results$x[2:38], 
                                 garden_simulation_results$y[1:3])

gt_plt_summary(mcSimulation_summary) 
```

Summary of the savings

```{r summary_decision}
summary(garden_simulation_results$y$decision)
```

Summary of costs

```{r summary_costs}
summary(garden_simulation_results$y$total_costs)
```

# First year

```{r summary_first_year_costs}
summary(garden_simulation_results$y$Cashflow_garden1)
```

# Cashflow of the garden option

```{r}
source("functions/plot_cashflow.R")
plot_cashflow(mcSimulation_object = garden_simulation_results, 
              cashflow_var_name = "Cashflow_garden")
```

# EVPI

```{r}
# Subset the outputs from the mcSimulation function (y) by selecting the correct variables be sure to run the multi_EVPI only on the variables that the we want.
mcSimulation_table <- data.frame(garden_simulation_results$x, 
                                 garden_simulation_results$y[1:3])
source("functions/multi_EVPI.R")
evpi <- multi_EVPI(mc = mcSimulation_table, first_out_var = "NPV_garden")

source("functions/plot_evpi.R")
plot_evpi(evpi, decision_vars = "decision")
```

# Projection to Latent Structure

Here we run a Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) model, a flexible type of regression model. The results of this model can give us some sense of the correlation strength and direction for model variables and our outcome variables.

```{r}
source("functions/pls_model.R")
pls_result <- pls_model(object = garden_simulation_results,
                                resultName = names(garden_simulation_results$y)[1], 
                                ncomp = 1)

input_table <- read.csv("inputs_kontum_garden.csv")
source("functions/plot_pls.R")
plot_pls(pls_result, input_table = input_table, threshold = 0)
```
